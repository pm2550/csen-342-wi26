    "**Topic:** Long-Term Memory, Vanishing Gradients, and Gating Mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem: Vanishing Gradients\n",
    "In the lecture, we learned that Vanilla RNNs struggle with long sequences. When you backpropagate through time (BPTT) over many steps, the gradient signal is repeatedly multiplied by the weight matrix. \n",
    "* If the weights are small, the gradient **vanishes** to zero (the model stops learning).\n",
    "* If the weights are large, the gradient **explodes** to infinity (the model destabilizes).\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes it nearly impossible for a standard RNN to connect an input at $t=0$ to an output at $t=100$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Solution: LSTMs\n",
    "Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks were explicitly designed to solve this. They introduce a **Cell State** ($C_t$) that acts as a superhighway for gradients, allowing information to flow unchanged over long distances.\n",

    "\n",
    "To prove this, we will use a classic benchmark called **The Adding Problem** (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997).\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Setup:**\n",
    "We feed the network a long sequence (length **100**). Each time step has 2 input numbers:\n",
    "1.  **Signal:** A random number between 0 and 1.\n",
    "2.  **Marker:** A binary flag (0 or 1). \n",
    "\n",
    "**The Rules:**\n",
    "* In the entire sequence of 100 steps, exactly **two** steps will have the Marker set to `1.0`.\n",
    "* All other steps have the Marker set to `0.0`.\n",
    "* The Goal: **Predict the sum of the two marked numbers.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is this hard?**\n",
    "The first number might appear at $t=5$ and the second at $t=95$. The model must hold the first number in memory for 90 steps, ignoring all the noise in between, to perform the addition at the end."

    "\n",
    "**1. The Vanilla RNN (Red Dashed Line):** \n",
    "Notice how the RNN loss flattens out around **0.167**. It has failed to find the markers. Because the sequence is so long (100 steps), the gradient signal vanishes before it reaches the start of the sequence. The RNN gives up and simply guesses the average ($1.0$), achieving the baseline loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. The LSTM (Green Solid Line):** \n",
    "The LSTM breaks through the baseline floor!  \n",
    "\n",
    "This confirms that the LSTM successfully learned to:\n",
    "1.  Identify the first marker.\n",
    "2.  Store its value in the **Cell State**.\n",
    "3.  Maintain that memory for ~50-90 steps.\n",
    "4.  Add it to the second marker when it appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ability to solve the \"Vanishing Gradient\" problem is why LSTMs (and Transformers) replaced simple RNNs in modern deep learning."
